I am Haobo Gu, an algorithm engineer at Alibaba Group. Before I came to Alibaba, I got my MS degree at University of Washington and bachelor degree at Tsinghua University. My research area is code intelligence, which is an exciting and interesting area. Code intelligence is about mining the latent value of code, learning from code repositories and then improving the work efficiency of all developers. Now, I am responsible for intelligent code completion algorithm, which is quite similiar with the text generation problem. If you are interested in this area, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:haobo.haobogu@alibaba-inc.com).
